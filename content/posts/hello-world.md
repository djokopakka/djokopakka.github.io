Hello everyone and welcome to my blog. This is an experiment for practicing my English writing, mostly random ideas and maybe some technical stuff. As you may expect this is an alias, a random name from a Richard K. Morgan novel plus a Pali term for barber (well, part of it).

So, for now..

```python
>>> print('Hello, World!')
```

and see you soon.
